According to my calendar I'm in day 146 of my Sabbatical. Time to count my blessings.

Let's start with some numbers:
* 1 marriage, to the love of my life.
* 1 birth of the best son in the world.
* 4 chickens growing healthily and a few days ago we marked our 250th egg.
* 4 batches of beer have been brewed.
* 1 batch of Kale, about to harvest the first 5 batches of Carrots, Cabbage, Broccoli
  Sprouts and Spinach. Strawberries and Lettuce are on the way too.
* 14 different crypto coins traded, riding the roller coaster that is crypto currencies.
* 2 Coursera courses; Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies <a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency>[1]</a> and 
 Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and algorighms <a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation>[2]</a> 
* 1 collaboration with my favorite charity Library for All as a volunteer.
* 1 non profit startup slash Open Source project called vol.community, see the prototype at
 <a href=https://vol.community>[3]</a> and start contributing <a href=https://github.com/volCommunity>[4]</a> if you are
  able to donate a little time. 

# What is going well
## Communication and agreement on time spent
Before starting the sabbatical I did tell my wife that the goal is to have time to explore new things,
that being a house keeper is not one of them. That sounds terrible. Let me defend myself; I do cook a few
days a week, bring the kids to school, change as many diapers as humanly possible. But I also claim 
hours of alone time a day, exploring whatever it is that I'm working on. I'm happy that I spend some time
clarifying and defending this.
## Dedicate a space
I've converted the shed into an office space, including a standing desk, a sweet 30 inch screen that
I grew accustomed to while being spoiled at <a href=http://www.atlassian.com>Atlassian</a> and 2 white boards.
It provides a natural barrier between the house with the hustle and bustle that comes with a family of 5. 
The fact that I need to turn the intercom on to hear baby stirring in his room, and that Ana or the
other kids need to walk across the garden makes all the difference.
At the same time it's close enough to spend time with the kids in morning and afternoons, share lunch,
prepare dinner without having to leave early, and being available for whenever A needs help.

# What could be better
Getting a baby certainly is a tad distracting. A good amount of focus, time and energy is absorbed
by having a firstborn. At the same time, it is amazing to be able as much stress free time as I
want.

At times it's hard not being able to bounce ideas at other people with a simlar skillset. White boards help, catchups
over video help, and going to local meetups help to keep in touch with people in the real world,
and being inspired.

This is my second blog post while I planned a much higher frequency of updates.

# How long will it last
That depends! It could last for more than a year, but I'm also excited about considering part time, remote,
work, and combining that with private projects and family life.

# What's in the cards for the remaining time
I'm excited to push vol.community to beta, and start launching a few startup ideas. There is a short list
of things I'd like to build that would work on the same technology stack, and it would be a shame
to not use the knowledge and code gained.

In regards to deepening and expanding knowledge, I'm about to learn more about statistics, and machine
learning with my friend Damien <a href=http://www.cli-nerd.com/>[5]</a>.

I also plan to more experience with IOT, there are some exciting projects that I'm considering collaborating on.

And last but not least, my first full grain brew, most likely a Belgian style strong ale. Cheers!
