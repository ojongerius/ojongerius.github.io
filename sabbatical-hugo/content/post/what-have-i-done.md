According to my calendar I'm in day 146 of my Sabbatical. Time to count my blessings.

Let's start with some numbers:
* Married 1, the love of my life A.
* Had one son, S.
* Raised 4 chickens and a few days ago we marked our 250th egg.
* Brewed 4 batches of beer.
* Harvested 1 batch of Kale, and am about to harvest the first batches of Carrots, Cabbage, Broccoli
  Sprouts and Spinach. Strawberries and Lettuce have just been planted.
* 14 different crypto coins traded, riding the roller coaster, or bubble if you will, that is crypto currencies.
* Followed 2 courses at Coursera; Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies [1] and Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies [2].
* Collaborated with 1, my favorite, charity Library for All [3] as a volunteer.
* 1 non profit startup slash Open Source project called vol.community [4], see the prototype at
  and start contributing at the Github project page [5] if you are able to donate a little time.
* Attended 1 conference and joined 44 local Meetup groups.

# What is going well
## Communication and agreement on time spent
Before starting the sabbatical I took some time an deffort to convince my wife that the goal is to have time to
 explore new things, house keeper being not one of them. That sound a terrible. Let me defend myself; I do cook a
few evening a week, bring the kids to school everyday and change as many diapers as humanly possible. But I also claim 
hours of alone time a day, exploring whatever it is that I'm working on. I'm happy that I spend some time
clarifying and defending this before hand.
## Dedicate a space
I've converted the shed into an office space, including a standing desk, a sweet 30 inch screen that
I grew accustomed to while being spoiled at <a href=http://www.atlassian.com>Atlassian</a> and 2 white boards.
It provides a natural barrier between the house with all the hustle and bustle that comes with a family of 5. 
The fact that I need to turn the intercom on to hear baby S stirring in his room, and that A or the
other kids need to walk across the garden makes all the difference.

At the same time it's close enough to spend time with the kids in morning and afternoons. Share lunches,
go for a walk or prepare dinner without having to leave early. And being available for whenever A needs help during the day.

# What could be better
Getting a baby certainly is just a tad distracting. A good amount of focus, time and energy is absorbed
by having a firstborn. At the same time, it is amazing to be able to has this much stress free time with room for 
improvisation.

At times it's hard not being able to bounce ideas at other people with a simlar skillset. White boards help, so does 
having regular catchups with peers over video calls. Going to local meetups and conferences helps to connect with locals of all 
 walks of life, and can be inspiring.

This is my second blog post while I planned a much higher frequency of updates.

# The future
I'm excited to push Vol.community to beta this week, and start launching a few startup ideas. There is a short list
of things I'd like to build that would work on the same technology stack, and it would be a shame
to not put the knowledge and code gained to use.

In regards to deepening and expanding knowledge, I'm about to study and experiment statistics and machine
learning with my friend Damien [6].

Getting more involved with IOT, there are some exciting projects that I've started to collaborate on.

And last but not least, my first full grain brew, most likely a Belgian style strong ale. Cheers!

# Call for action
I'd love from people all over the world to:
 * Add volunteering sites in their countries to Vol.community. All it takes is an isssue containing a list of sites to
  get the ball rolling. Code to parse those sites is optional, but welcome.
 * Propose or implement design improvements.
