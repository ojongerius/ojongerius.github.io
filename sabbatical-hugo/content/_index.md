Otto Jongerius recently moved to Wellington, New Zealand, in order to be with the love of his life,
 Ana, and her two kids.  His son is expected to make an appearance in late June 2017.

Until recently Otto worked at <a href=http://www.atlassian.com>Atlassian</a> firstly in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, then
 Sydney, Australia for the past five years.  Otto has spoken at tech events in London, Tokyo and Sydney.
He contributes to Open Source and volunteers at <a href=http://www.libraryforall.org>Library for all</a>.

His move to Wellington kicks off an experimental sabbatical for 12 months.  During this time he will become a Dad,
vegetable and chicken farmer.  He also intends to tinker with robots, experiment in the open source environment all while
 maintaining a keen eye on the global tech scene. 
Otto can also be found conquering the amazing mountain bike trails around Wellington in his spare time.
