Otto Jongerius recently moved to Wellington, New Zealand, in order to be with the love of his life, Ana, and her two kids.  His son is made an appearance in late June 2017.

Until recently Otto worked at <a href=http://www.atlassian.com>Atlassian</a> for the past five years, firstly in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, then Sydney, Australia. Otto has spoken at tech events in London, Tokyo and Sydney. He contributes to Open Source and volunteers at <a href=http://www.freecodecamp.org>freeCodeCamp</a>.

His move to Wellington kicked off an experimental sabbatical for 12 months. During this time he became a Dad, vegetable and chicken farmer. He also tinkered with robots, experiment in the open source environment all while maintaining a keen eye on the global tech scene.  Otto can also be found conquering the amazing mountain bike trails around Wellington in his spare time.
